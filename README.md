Hi, I’m @paulbernard23.

I’m interested in health and data science. As such, I completed a PharmD and a Msc in "statistics and health data" in France.
In my free time I like to work on my own project which will be stored here.

If you want to reach me for a job opportunity feel free to contact me at paul.bernard.23@protonmail.com.
